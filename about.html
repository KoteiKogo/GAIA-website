			<h1> About Us Page! </h1>
		
			<p> This page will help you learn more about GAIA itself and what it seeks to complete!<p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p> Here at GAIA we want to spread awareness of these very dangerous and threatings issues ecosystems are going under, </br>
				no matter how big or small the issue is we'll still address it! we believe that if no one is going to tell the world </br>
				what is happening to these ecosystems we both love and require to maintain our lives & world, we should aid these </br>
				ecosytems to ensure that we humans do not get endanger by the lose of these said ecosystems! </p>

			</br>
			
			<p> With our word being spread, we hope that it is able to reach not only other fellow companies who may not be involved </br>
				in these types of stuff, but also governments across the world to take action against these threats! however, </br>
				we also wanna let the general public know about these problems so they not only spread our word but also be able </br>
				to realise that they have the problem to help stop these threats through their own actions alone! </p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p> Besides spreading the word of these threats getting to a range of different people, we also offer all sorts of </br>
				Soluations to these problems that will help either lessen it's impact upon the ecosystems we wish to protect or </br>
				it removes it entirely to avoid it ever being a threat again to these places! </p>
