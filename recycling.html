			<p> Recycling is helps ensure that things such as bottles, cans, and other general waste
				such as food is properly taken care of in a orderly and sorted way so that they can
				be taken care off without harming the ecosystem. </p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p> another way Recycling can be use is by repurposing & reusing these waste into
				something you'll be able to use thoughout your life or for these items to get
				remade into a brand new version of it or something entirely different! </p>
			
			</br>

			<p> Here at GAIA we've been actively per-taking and promoting the usage of Recycling
				methods across the world from companies that control asserts across the planet,
				the government that governors over these ecosystems and everyday people!<p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p> We strongly believe that recycling is the easier and most important soulation
				to aiding the world and it's ecosystems from being endangered! as a majority
				of issues these systems are facing come from the waste we humans leave behind
				without properly taking care of them!</p>
