			<p> This page will talk about the Forests and their main issue!<p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p> The Forests holds some of the greatest and more important plant live to ever exist! </br>
				one example being trees providing air for us humans and animals to breath in mainly, </br>
				but also for other local plant lives that benefit from these trees that help growth </br>
				and develop them to their fullest! just showing how key trees are for everything! </p>

			<p> However, there has been a growing concern and worry about the large amount of </br>
				Woodcutting taking place around the whole. As more trees get cut down rapidly </br>
				and there's growth is only slowly increasing naturally, whole forests get completely </br>
				wiped out by the desire of materials that wood provides for humans. </p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p> not only does this displace large amounts of spieces that required these trees </br>
				to survive and function off on, but it's also preventing more clean air for us to </br>
				breath in while also not being able to absorb these gases that prevent our plant </br>
				from overheating. </p>
			
			</br>

		<div class="blue">
		
			<p> However there a soluation that will help lessen the impact woodcutting does on </br>
				the plant. Replanting trees while it takes it time to fully grow into a proper </br>
				tree, it's far better than keeping these forests without any trees to shield </br>
				these ecosytems that require trees to live. <p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p> We at GAIA have serveal replantation projects across the world to help limit </br>
				the damage dealt by large-scale woodcutting in these regions and we hope that </br>
				governments take a firmly stance on aidding replanting effects to help maintain </br>
				these native ecosytems to their countries. </p>
