			<p> This page will talk about the Seas and their main issue! <p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p> Seas all across the world hold some of the most beautiful and mysterious creatures this planet </br>
				has to offer! ranging from the lovable dolphin to the creepy anglerfish, no matter what they are </br>
				they're all incredile in their own right! </p>

			<p> However with humans processing larger amounts of waste that we careless throw away wherever we </br>
				happen to be, a lot of this ends up being tossed into the sea that drifts along endless. Due to </br>
				most waste being plastic it takes decades perhaps even longer to see plastic begen to decay </br>
				which of course, sees these unnatural objects affect the seas they so happen to be in.</p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p> This waste ends up harming not only the wild life living within the seas but also the plant life </br>
				growing underneath the waves. Some waste processes these harmful chemicals into the water which </br>
				goes into the lungs of whatever it comes into contact with, making these creatures very ill. Waste </br>
				can also get itself stuck on creatures that are trying to swim by, causing a great deal of discomfort </br>
				for these animals and long-term health issues cause of it. </p>
			
			</br>

			<p> Luckily there's a solution to help limit and hopefully eventually get rid of this waste problem </br>
				for good! that being preventing waste from being dumped into the seas, while the current waste </br>
				that has already been tossed into the sea to be picked up and placed properly where it should've been.<p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p> GAIA has been aidding not only big projects to help remove large piles of waste found deep in the sea, </br>
				but also more local events that pick up waste found on their shores! we hope with out involvement </br>
				alongside spreading the general awareness of these problems, the government will take more action </br>
				towards how waste is properly taken care off. </p>
