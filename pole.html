			<h1> Poles Page! </h1>
		
			<p> This page will talk about the poles and their main issue! <p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p> The poles are the last bit of land we humans have yet to fully explore, </br>
				meaning that there possible might be whole new spieces we have yet to find out </br>
				about underneath the giant ice sheets of the poles! </p>

			<p> This means with the world getting ever more increasing hotter each year, </br>
				it steadily to melt away at the poles causing these unknown creatures </br>
				alongside already existing ones we know of such as polar bears to lose more </br>
				area for them to live on.</p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p> Alongside the loss of land for the creatures living in the poles, </br>
				the ice melting also results in sea levels rising all across the world which </br>
				while only slightly, it'll eventually drown out other ecosystems while the Poles </br>
				and their ecosystems also get effected by their ice being melted away. </p>

			<p> One solution to this problem is reducing the amount of C02 we process into our plant. </br>
				There's a whole range of possibles we can do to reduce C02 such as turning to more </br>
				green energy like wind turbins, dams and so on that don't let out C02 after being used. <p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p> GAIA has been promoting more green sources that will help reduce C02 from being released </br>
				into our planet, seeing it as something that not only helps prevents the poles from </br>
				melting but it also is a better long-term use of energy rather than fossil fuels which </br>
				are only one-usage. </p>
